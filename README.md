# snakeGame
this will be further used for an ai training itself to play the game

currently up for pull requests!

updates required are :
  1) the size of the play area is currently 300 * 300,a bigger one would be appreciated
  2) the treats should not spawn inside the snake
  3) the head of the snake should be of a different colour than the body, this would help in understanding where it is heading
  4) the start length of the snake should be 3 and it's orientation on spawn should be random
  5) the score should be visible on hte cv2 frame itself rather than being printed on the notebook.
  
Let's celebrate hacktober together!
